üñ•Ô∏è C-Projects üöÄ

Hello! üëã

This is a collection of my simple projects made using the C language.

To view These repository online using Codespaces, follow these steps:

‚Ä¢	Click on the "Code" button on the right side of the screen.

‚Ä¢	In the dropdown menu, select "Open with Codespaces".

‚Ä¢	Once the environment is set up, you'll be taken to the Codespaces editor where you can view the C project's files and folders.

‚Ä¢	To run the project, you can use the terminal in the Codespaces editor to navigate to the project directory and compile and run the code.

‚Ä¢	you can navigate to the project directory in the terminal by typing cd project-name where "project-name" is the name of your project directory.

‚Ä¢	To compile the code, you can use a C compiler such as GCC by running the command gcc file.c -o executable where "file.c" is the name of your C source file and "executable" is the name you want to give to the compiled binary executable file.

‚Ä¢	After successfully compiling the code, you can run the executable by typing ./executable in the terminal. This will execute your program and produce output if it is designed to do so.
